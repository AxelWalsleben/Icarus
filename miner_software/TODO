1. Miner proformance low when network condition is bad. because if the 
   data transmission to pool fail or cost more than 6 sec time, the 
   fpga's WDT will restart the FPGA, and will cause the miner software
   fail and restart.

2. miner software don't support longpool, this cause a 1-2% speed lose.
